# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage was created in preparation for the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp. I built this project in order to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and put the new knowledge into application. It is a basic website where I can store key notes about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript in a visually organized manner.  

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section contains notes about one of the four topics. If you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics learned from prework and choose one topic for you to study first.

## Credits

Me, Myself, and I.
